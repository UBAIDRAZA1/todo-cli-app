## Phase 1 – Console Todo Application

This project is **Phase 1** of a Todo Application built as a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** tool.

### 📌 Phase 1 Scope
In this phase, the application focuses on core CLI functionality only.

### ✨ Features
- Add a new todo item
- View all todo items
- Mark a todo as completed
- Delete a todo item
- In-memory storage (no database, no file persistence)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: JavaScript / TypeScript (CLI based)
- Runtime: Node.js
- Interface: Console / Terminal

### 🚫 Limitations (Phase 1)
- No database
- No file saving
- Data resets when the program exits
- No GUI (CLI only)

### 🎯 Goal
The goal of Phase 1 is to understand:
- CLI-based application structure
- Command handling
- Core logic separation
- Clean and modular code design

### 📍 Future Phases
- Phase 2: Persistence (File / DB)
- Phase 3: Advanced features & validations
- Phase 4: Optional UI or API integration
