# Implementation Plan: Phase I – Console Todo App

**Branch**: `1-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: specs/1-console-todo-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/1-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a fully functional CLI-based Todo app for Phase I of Hackathon II. The app will utilize spec-driven development, Python in-memory data structures, and AI agents for code generation. It will support basic task operations (add, delete, update, mark complete, list) with a clear CLI input format, graceful error handling, and robust testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external libraries beyond core Python)  
**Storage**: In-memory Python data structures (list of `Task` objects)  
**Testing**: `pytest`  
**Target Platform**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)
**Project Type**: Single project  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all CLI commands.  
**Constraints**: No persistent database; use in-memory data structures. No manual coding allowed; all functionality generated by AI agents. Complete Phase I within hackathon schedule.  
**Scale/Scope**: Manage up to 100 tasks within a single session.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **AI-Native Development**: Is the feature designed to be implemented via spec-driven code generation? (Yes, explicitly stated in the plan and constitution)
- [X] **CLI-First Approach**: Does the plan prioritize a functional command-line interface? (Yes, the entire app is CLI-based for Phase I)
- [X] **Modularity**: Is the proposed structure modular and prepared for future evolution? (Yes, a clear separation of concerns (data model, CLI logic) will facilitate future web/chatbot integration)
- [X] **Accuracy & Reliability**: Does the plan ensure all behaviors align with the specification? (Yes, through spec-driven testing and detailed acceptance criteria)
- [X] **Stateless Design**: Does the design adhere to stateless principles within memory constraints? (Yes, the in-memory data structure is explicitly managed per session, maintaining statelessness across command invocations from the user's perspective, without server-side persistence).

```

**Structure Decision**: The single project structure is chosen as it provides sufficient organization for Phase I's scope while remaining simple and focused on the CLI application. This facilitates clear separation of concerns without introducing unnecessary complexity.
