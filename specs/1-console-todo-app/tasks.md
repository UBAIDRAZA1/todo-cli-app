# Tasks: Phase I – Console Todo App

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/1-console-todo-app/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required for user stories)

**Tests**: All tasks will include test generation, assuming a TDD approach for this spec-driven project.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on `plan.md` structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project directories: `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/cli/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`
- [X] T002 Initialize Python project (e.g., `pyproject.toml`) and install `pytest`
- [X] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (e.g., `flake8`, `black`)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Create `src/models/task.py` with `Task` class (id, description, completed)
- [ ] T005 Create `tests/unit/test_task_model.py` for `Task` class
- [X] T006 Create `src/services/task_service.py` with in-memory task storage and basic CRUD operations (add, get by id, get all, delete)
- [ ] T007 Create `tests/unit/test_task_service.py` for `TaskService` CRUD operations
- [ ] T008 Create `app.py` as the main entry point for the CLI application
- [ ] T009 Create `src/cli/parser.py` for parsing CLI commands (`todo <command> [arguments]`) and handling invalid commands
- [ ] T010 Create `tests/unit/test_cli_parser.py` for CLI parser, including invalid command handling

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add a task (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Allow users to add new tasks.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo add "task description"` and then `todo list` should show the new task.

### Tests for User Story 1
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create `tests/integration/test_add_task.py` for `todo add` command
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Add test cases for duplicate tasks in `tests/integration/test_add_task.py`

### Implementation for User Story 1
- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement `add` command logic in `src/cli/commands.py` (or integrated into `app.py` depending on structure generated by AI)
- [ ] T014 [US1] Integrate `add` command into `app.py`'s main CLI loop

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 (Add task) should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - List tasks (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Allow users to view all tasks with their status.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo list` should display tasks with correct `[X]` or `[ ]` prefix.

### Tests for User Story 2
- [ ] T015 [P] [US2] Create `tests/integration/test_list_tasks.py` for `todo list` command
- [ ] T016 [P] [US2] Add test cases for displaying completed and pending tasks in `tests/integration/test_list_tasks.py`

### Implementation for User Story 2
- [ ] T017 [US2] Implement `list` command logic in `src/cli/commands.py` to display tasks with `[X]/[ ]` prefix
- [ ] T018 [US2] Integrate `list` command into `app.py`'s main CLI loop

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 (List tasks) should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 6 - Handle invalid commands (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Gracefully handle invalid commands with helpful feedback.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo unknown-command` should display an error message and available commands.

### Tests for User Story 6
- [ ] T019 [P] [US6] Add test cases for invalid commands in `tests/unit/test_cli_parser.py` (if not already covered by T010) or `tests/integration/test_invalid_command.py`

### Implementation for User Story 6
- [ ] T020 [US6] Refine `src/cli/parser.py` and `app.py` to ensure consistent "Error: " prefix for all error messages and display available commands on invalid input.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 6 (Invalid commands) should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Update a task (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to update existing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo update <id> "new description"` should change the task description.

### Tests for User Story 3
- [ ] T021 [P] [US3] Create `tests/integration/test_update_task.py` for `todo update` command
- [ ] T022 [P] [US3] Add test cases for updating non-existent task IDs in `tests/integration/test_update_task.py`

### Implementation for User Story 3
- [ ] T023 [US3] Implement `update` command logic in `src/cli/commands.py`
- [ ] T024 [US3] Integrate `update` command into `app.py`'s main CLI loop

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 (Update task) should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 7: User Story 4 - Mark a task complete (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to mark tasks as complete.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo complete <id>` should change the task's completion status.

### Tests for User Story 4
- [ ] T025 [P] [US4] Create `tests/integration/test_complete_task.py` for `todo complete` command
- [ ] T026 [P] [US4] Add test cases for completing non-existent task IDs in `tests/integration/test_complete_task.py`

### Implementation for User Story 4
- [ ] T027 [US4] Implement `complete` command logic in `src/cli/commands.py`
- [ ] T028 [US4] Integrate `complete` command into `app.py`'s main CLI loop

**Checkpoint**: User Story 4 (Mark complete) should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 8: User Story 5 - Delete a task (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow users to delete tasks.

**Independent Test**: Running `todo delete <id>` should remove the task from the list.

### Tests for User Story 5
- [ ] T029 [P] [US5] Create `tests/integration/test_delete_task.py` for `todo delete` command
- [ ] T030 [P] [US5] Add test cases for deleting non-existent task IDs in `tests/integration/test_delete_task.py`

### Implementation for User Story 5
- [ ] T031 [US5] Implement `delete` command logic in `src/cli/commands.py`
- [ ] T032 [US5] Integrate `delete` command into `app.py`'s main CLI loop

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T033 [P] Review and standardize all error messages to be prefixed with "Error: ".
- [ ] T034 [P] Implement handling for adding a task with an empty description (e.g., `todo add ""`).
- [ ] T035 Code cleanup and refactoring across all implemented modules.
- [ ] T036 Create `quickstart.md` documentation for setting up and running the app.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 6 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before CLI commands
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 2, and 6 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Implementations within a story can be broken down further for parallel work where appropriate.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1, 2, 6)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Add task)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (List tasks)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 6 (Handle invalid commands)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Add) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (List) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 6 (Invalid Commands) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 (Update) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 4 (Complete) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 5 (Delete) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Add)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (List)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Invalid Commands)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (Update)
   - Developer E: User Story 4 (Complete)
   - Developer F: User Story 5 (Delete)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
